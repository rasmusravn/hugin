# Visual Concept Prompts for Hugin
These prompts are designed for generative AI image tools to create conceptual artwork for the Hugin project.

## Prompt 1: The Hugin Ball (Detailed Technical)

```
A transparent spherical sensor ball cutaway view showing internal electronics. Inside the clear sphere:
- A Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller board (green PCB with wireless antenna symbol)
- An MPU6050 IMU sensor module (small blue breakout board with 6-axis motion tracking)
- A VL53L1X Time-of-Flight distance sensor (small purple board with clear sensor window pointing outward)
- A small LiPo battery pack (silver rectangular pouch)
- Thin colored wires connecting components (red for power, black for ground, blue and yellow for I2C data lines)

The sphere is approximately tennis ball sized (6-7cm diameter). The ToF sensor has a clear window in the sphere's surface pointing forward. Small mounting posts visible inside holding components in place. Professional technical illustration style with labels pointing to each component. Clean white background. Isometric 3/4 view showing the interior layout clearly.

## Prompt 2: The Complete Hugin System (Conceptual)

```
A split-scene illustration showing the Hugin spatial mapping system:

LEFT SIDE: A modern living room interior with furniture. A translucent glowing sensor ball is mid-flight through the air, with motion blur trails showing its arc trajectory. Subtle WiFi signal waves (blue translucent waves) emanating from the ball toward a device. The ball is softball-sized, with a faint glow from internal LEDs and visible circuit board elements through semi-transparent shell.

RIGHT SIDE: A Jetson Orin Nano developer board on a desk with a monitor displaying a colorful 3D point cloud visualization of the same room being mapped in real-time. The point cloud shows walls, furniture, and room structure as thousands of colored dots forming a recognizable 3D space. Ethernet cable and power adapter visible.

Center: Elegant curved arrow showing data flow from ball to base station labeled "WiFi UDP Stream 50Hz".

Style: Clean, modern technical illustration with soft lighting. Teal and orange accent colors. Professional yet approachable aesthetic. Slight sci-fi feel but grounded in reality.

## Prompt 3: Action Shot (Marketing Style)

```
An energetic action photograph showing a human hand throwing a glowing sensor ball through a modern apartment interior. The ball is captured mid-flight with slight motion blur, LED indicator lights glowing blue inside a translucent white spherical shell.

Background: Blurred interior showing walls, doorway, and furniture with depth of field effect.

Foreground: Sharp focus on the flying ball, with subtle WiFi signal visualization (animated particle effects) trailing behind it showing data transmission in real-time.

Overlay graphics: Floating technical data overlays showing:
- "DISTANCE: 2.3m"
- "ORIENTATION: 45° pitch"
- "PACKETS: 50/sec"
- Small 3D coordinate axes showing X/Y/Z orientation

Style: Dynamic product photography meets technical demonstration. High contrast, dramatic lighting, teal color grading, professional tech startup aesthetic. 16:9 aspect ratio suitable for website hero image.

## Prompt 4: Component Breakdown (Educational)

```
An exploded view technical diagram of the Hugin sensor ball showing all components separated along a vertical axis:

From top to bottom:
1. Transparent hemisphere (upper shell) - clear plastic with mounting bosses
2. VL53L1X ToF sensor - small purple breakout board with clear sensor lens
3. MPU6050 IMU - small blue/green breakout board
4. Raspberry Pi Pico W - green circuit board with RP2040 chip visible and WiFi antenna
5. LiPo battery - silver pouch cell with JST connector
6. Transparent hemisphere (lower shell) - matching bottom half

Thin dotted lines connecting each component to its position in the assembled sphere (shown as ghost outline on right side). Each component has a label with name and simple icon. Clean white background. Orthographic projection. Technical manual style with precise spacing between components. Scale bar showing 5cm reference.

Color scheme: Components in realistic colors, shells in light blue transparency, labels in dark gray text, connection lines in thin orange dashes.

## Prompt 5: The Norse Mythology Connection

```
A artistic concept illustration blending Norse mythology with modern technology:

Foreground: The Hugin sensor ball (realistic hardware) resting on an ancient wooden table with runic carvings. Ball is semi-transparent showing circuit boards inside, with a faint ethereal blue glow.

Background: A stylized raven (Hugin, Odin's messenger) in flight, but composed of cyan wireframe mesh and flowing data particles, suggesting both the mythological bird and digital data transmission. The raven's path creates WiFi signal waves.

Middle ground: Faint holographic projection of a room being mapped, with Norse knotwork patterns subtly integrated into the 3D point cloud visualization.

Text overlay: "Hugin - Scout. Map. Return." in runic-inspired modern font.

Style: Blend of ancient Nordic aesthetics with cyberpunk/sci-fi technology. Moody dramatic lighting, deep blues and silvers, mystical yet technical. Concept art quality, painterly digital illustration style.A artistic concept illustration blending Norse mythology with modern technology:

## Usage Notes

- These prompts work best with AI image generators like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion
- Adjust technical detail level based on intended audience (technical vs. general public)
- Prompts 1-4 are more educational/documentation focused
- Prompts 5-6 are more marketing/artistic focused
- Consider generating multiple variations and combining elements from different results
